    Match between the model state dict and pretrained weight state dict.
    Return the matched state dict.

    The method supposes that all the names in pretrained weight state dict are
    subclass of the names in models`, if the prefix 'backbone.' in pretrained weight
    keys is stripped. And we could get the candidates for each model key. Then we 
    select the name with the longest matched size as the final match result. For
    example, the model state dict has the name of 
    'backbone.res2.res2a.branch2a.conv.weight' and the pretrained weight as
    name of 'res2.res2a.branch2a.conv.weight' and 'branch2a.conv.weight'. We
    match the 'res2.res2a.branch2a.conv.weight' to the model key.
