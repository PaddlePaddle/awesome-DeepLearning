money-supply	fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy u s banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy but they do support the market s assumption that the federal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit economists said it s clear that the fed has firmed somewhat discount window borrowings net free reserves the fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening said dana johnson of first chicago corp johnson and several other economists now estimate that the fed funds rate should trade between and pct discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were mln dlrs a day producing a daily average for the two week statement period of mln dlrs the highest since the week of december and up from mln dlrs previously moreover banks were forced to borrow a huge billion dlrs from the fed on wednesday the highest daily total this year even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at the fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the fed had anticipated however economists said it is almost certain that the fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week they pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week first economists now expect m money supply for the week ended april to rise by a staggering to billion dlrs partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes as banks checking account liabilities rise so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed required reserves did indeed rise sharply by billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday but economists said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected m surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late second an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently left wall street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed economists said thus although there were billion dlrs of repos outstanding on wednesday night the fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so it s not at all inconceivable that the fed didn t add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting discount window borrowings of about mln dlrs a day equivalent to a fed funds rate of around pct after citing the reasons why the fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy jeffrey leeds of chemical bank had not been convinced that the fed was tightening policy but after reviewing today s figures he said it s fair to say that the fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture leeds expects fed funds to trade between and pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar s fall gathers pace johnson at first chicago agreed citing political opposition in washington to a dollar defense package at a time when congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the u s trade surplus with japan reuter

tin	tin traders response muted to kl futures market european free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a kuala lumpur dollar based tin futures market due to be launched in october traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for japan and other south east asian tin interests although european traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current free market system which has been operating since london metal exchange lme tin trading ceased in october dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries there is also a view among european traders that while the proposed kuala lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point a market inaugurated by the malaysian government in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade would make participants uncomfortable some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the london metal exchange but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding high court litigation actions have been resolved spot tin prices on the european free market are currently around stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse rotterdam over the past months the price moved to a ten year low of stg in march and rebounded to as high as stg in december this compares with stg last paid when lme trading ceased in october and a record high tin price of stg traded for cash standard grade metal in june of that year lme warehouse stocks are now near a two year low at tonnes having fallen steadily from a record high of tonnes reached in february traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply demand deficit of some tonnes analysts were predicting prices of up to stg per tonne during however the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to stg last month after approaching stg in december the decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers there was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year traders say the itc creditor banks original tin holdings of nearly tonnes have now been almost halved and the bulk of material still available is being held by malaysian and japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal some tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the international tin council s itc buffer stock manager halted support operations on the lme on behalf of the members nations of the international tin agreement the overhang of metal was reduced further by broker shearson lehman brothers which earlier this year reported having sold its itc related holdings and halved its overall tin position analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in european tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter the association of tin producing countries atpc has made efforts since the collapse of the ita to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella but to date brazil and china two major producers remain unaffected by the atpc argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main european trading centres dealers said reuter

coffee	european coffee trade proposes new quota formula european coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating international coffee organization ico quotas dutch coffee trade association chairman chairman frits van horick said van horick who is a council member of the european coffee federation was speaking at the end of the ecf annual meeting the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give brazil the world s biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van horick said if accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ico the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van horick said coffee quotas were suspended in february last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought induced crop disaster in brazil although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re introduction brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota but our proposal leaves it very little to object to van horick said the existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as colombia kenya indonesia and costa rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the ivory coast el salvador and nicaragua would lose quota share van horick said because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year s quota if the ico consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the september meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula van horick said at the same time much will depend on brazil s attitude brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side if there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van horick added reuter

stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets david ruder a year old republican law professor at northwestern university in evanston ill was named thursday to be the rd chairman of the five member u s securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall street s most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some u s securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the u s corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by u s and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec s ability to enforce u s securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency s review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the e f hutton investment banking firm brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency s enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter a democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission s current priorities the sec currently has about employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy later to become the nation s th president

gnp	u s economy slowdown raises recession fears the economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in u s exports should falter economists say growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up they say these factors raise the question is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession said lyle gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers association and a former federal reserve board official the commerce department said this week that the economy grew by a robust pct annual rate in the first quarter but a u s monetary official called it a weak report housing starts fell pct in may and consumer spending rose a weak per cent our two largest visible industries autos and housing are faltering but exports are picking up some of the slack martin mauro senior economist for merrill lynch economics told reuters gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages to offset this u s exports must continue to rise returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption he says i expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening but it is a close call gramley said federal reserve board governor martha seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia seger said that with the recovery stumbling along the pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy possibly a signal that the fed will be accommodative most economists predict growth slower than the pct forecast by the reagan administration for and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession mauro said a pct rise in industrial production in may came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry where an inventory overhang still exists he says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper chemicals and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar they are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity but i think they will keep us out of a recession mauro said in a speech to financial planners this week beryl sprinkel the chief white house economic adviser predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve prospects for continued economic growth through and into are still quite favorable he said but private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation allen sinai chief economist at shearson lehman brothers inc told congress this week that inflation would rise to to five pct this year and stay at that level through after a pct increase in the rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services he said the lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle it continues to persist he said adding he would like the fed to tighten credit a major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar which should continue to fall and feed inflation says a prominent international banker rainer gut chairman of credit suisse told the national press club that the dollar s downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the united states is the world s largest debtor nation the swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five year boom on world equity markets will go on forever it is very difficult to be optimistic gut said reuter

coffee	u s coffee import reporting system questioned a voluntary compliance system for monitoring u s coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources many sectors of the trade including large roasters and importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other one analyst said on monday a national coffee association newsletter said the office of u s trade representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill under the arrangement milar to one in coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the u s government until congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry while many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the u s others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines a u s customs spokesman said customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesn t have the authority to demand form o documents tracking merchandise from source to destination he said many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement said one major u s roaster last time we had a gentleman s agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman said another analyst adding without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers hands some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two tier market in which non member countries buy coffee at a big discount many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non member countries at discounts and then bring it into the u s falsely labelled according to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non member destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans if there s that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions said paine webber analyst bernie savaiko still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the u s in the near term it would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but i think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee i don t think that it poses that much of a threat one trader said reuter
