Before submitting a bug report, please be aware that your issue **must be reproducible** with all of the following, otherwise it is non-actionable, and we can not help you:
 - **Current repo**: run `git fetch && git status -uno` to check and `git pull` to update repo
 - **Common dataset**: coco.yaml or coco128.yaml
 - **Common environment**: Colab, Google Cloud, or Docker image. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#environments
 
If this is a custom dataset/training question you **must include** your `train*.jpg`, `test*.jpg` and `results.png` figures, or we can not help you. You can generate these with `utils.plot_results()`.
