# chapter 6, Sentiment Classification [[简体中文](./README.md)]

## Introduction
In this chapter, we will introduce sentiment classification as the application of natural language processing (NLP). Firstly, the basic knowledge and application scenarios of sentiment classification will be introduced. Secondly, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the long-short-term memory network (LSTM) will be introduced. At last, we will model the sentiment classification based on LSTM，and implement it with paddle. We hope that through the study of this chapter, you can master the theoretical knowledge and their usage.
