# Computer Vision: Image Classification[[简体中文](./README.md)]

## Introduction
In this chapter, we will learn several basic modules of Convolutional Neural Network, including convolution, pooling, batch normalization, and dropout. At the same time, the classical model structure of image classification algorithm is introduced, including: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and the application of the algorithm is shown through the case of eye disease screening. I hope that through the study of this chapter, we have a basic understanding of computer vision and image classification tasks.
