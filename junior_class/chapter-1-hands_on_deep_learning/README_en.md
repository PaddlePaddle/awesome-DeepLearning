# **Hands On Deep Learning [[简体中文](./README.md)]**

## **Introduction**

This chapter takes you to get started quickly with deep learning, including an overview of machine learning and deep learning, and an introduction to the open-source deep learning platform of PaddlePaddle. Boston housing price prediction is a classic machine learning task, similar to the "Hello World" of the programmer world. Taking the "Boston housing price prediction" task as an example, I will introduce you to the thinking process and thinking process of using Python language and Numpy library to build neural network models. Operation method; at the same time use PaddlePaddle to rewrite the housing price prediction model.
