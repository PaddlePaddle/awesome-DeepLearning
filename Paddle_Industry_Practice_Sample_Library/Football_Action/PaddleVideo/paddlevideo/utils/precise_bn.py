    Recompute and update the batch norm stats to make them more precise. During
    training both BN stats and the weight are changing after every iteration, so
    the running average can not precisely reflect the actual stats of the
    current model.
    In this function, the BN stats are recomputed with fixed weights, to make
    the running average more precise. Specifically, it computes the true average
    of per-batch mean/variance instead of the running average.
    This is useful to improve validation accuracy.

        model: the model whose bn stats will be recomputed
        data_loader: an iterator. Produce data as input to the model
        num_iters: number of iterations to compute the stats.
